        <h2>2 Nephi 4:26-30</h2>
        <p>
          26 O then, if I have seen so great things, if the Lord in his condescension unto the children of men hath
          visited men in so much mercy, why should my heart weep and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow, and my
          flesh waste away, and my strength slacken, because of mine afflictions? 27 And why should I yield to sin,
          because of my flesh? Yea, why should I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in my heart to
          destroy my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry because of mine enemy? 28 Awake, my soul! No longer droop
          in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul. 29 Do not anger again because of
          mine enemies. Do not slacken my strength because of mine afflictions. 30 Rejoice, O my heart, and cry unto the
          Lord, and say: O Lord, I will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee, my God, and the rock of
          my salvation.

        <h2>Alma 48:11-13, 17</h2>
        <p>
          11 And Moroni was a strong and a mighty man; he was a man of a perfect understanding; yea, a man that did not
          delight in bloodshed; a man whose soul did joy in the liberty and the freedom of his country, and his brethren
          from bondage and slavery; 12 Yea, a man whose heart did swell with thanksgiving to his God, for the many
          privileges and blessings which he bestowed upon his people; a man who did labor exceedingly for the welfare
          and safety of his people. 13 Yea, and he was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ, and he had sworn with
          an oath to defend his people, his rights, and his country, and his religion, even to the loss of his blood. 17
          Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, if all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni,
          behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the
          hearts of the children of men.
